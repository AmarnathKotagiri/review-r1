# Review R THA
To submit, please perform the following:
1. Save a script file for R with the following name: `tha_lastname_firstname.R` where lastname is your last name and firstname is your first name.
1. Save your screenshots (if any) to the directory `assets`.
1. Link your screenshots (if any) in `submission.md` where appropriate.
1. Answer questions (if any) in `submission.md`.
1. Push your assignment to GitHub.

### Vectors and Lists (2 pts.)
Create three vectors, two which are numeric and one which has characters. Give each vector at least 5 items. Thus, your first vector should have at least 5 different numbers, your second vector at least 5 different numbers, and your third vector at least 5 different characters or strings.

Create a list that contains all three vectors. Output the result to the console screen. Take a screen capture of the console output, save the image to `assets`, and link the image to `submission.md`.

### Iteration and Math with While (3 pts.)
Create a `while` loop that prints the value for odd numbers only. Include the following text in the print: "Printing the value i." where `i` is the value printed. Loop through a list containing numbers 1 to 10.

### Functions and Parameters (5 pts.)
The following tasks will create a function with output. Perform the following tasks.
* Name the function `my_function` and provide it with three parameters (two of the parameters will be strings, one an integer)
* The first line within your function should contain a comment like the following, where `NAME` is your full name
```R
#================================
# This function written by NAME
```
* After the comment, use an if-else statement to evaluate if the two strings have unequal lengths; if they do, print 'Unequal lengths', otherwise print 'Equal lengths'
* Perform a math operation of your choice using the length of one of your strings with your numerical variable;  print out `Math is
 fun: <outcome>` where `<outcome>` is the result of your math operation.
* Create three variables outside the function (two strings and one an integer) and give them values.
* Pass in those variables to your function.
* Take a screen capture, save the image, and link in `submission.md`.
